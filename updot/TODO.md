# TODO

## Investigations

* Figure out why VSCode "debug unit test method" doesn't do anything (but "debug all unit tests" works)

## Setup.py

* Create/teardown .venv with full dev tooling (do we want to use requirements.txt any more?)
* Pip upgrade (though maybe this is just a delete/recreate venv)
* Detect unexpected packages in venv that aren't known to setup.py (i.e. I forgot to add them to the script)
* Reformat all code
* Sort usings all code
* Lint all code
* Run all tests
* Run specific test through pdbpp
