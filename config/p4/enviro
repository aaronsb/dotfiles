# this file is a global p4 config, which will be overridden per-var by p4config
# files in the project folders.
#
# setup:
#
# p4 set P4ENVIRO="$(resolve-path ~/.config/p4/enviro)"
#
# note that once this is set, `p4 set` will start writing data directly into this file. this also
# happens when accessing a depot via ssl - an entry like `P4_ssl:<hostname>:1666_CHARSET=none` will
# show up in this file. to keep server names out of here, move the key/value to a REG_SZ in
# `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perforce\Environment`
